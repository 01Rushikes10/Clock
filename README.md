# Clock
The clock application you have created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript is a digital clock that displays the current time and updates in real-time

The clock application utilizes the following components:

    HTML: The HTML structure provides the foundation for the clock application. It includes a container element to hold the clock display and separate elements to display the hours, minutes, and seconds.

    CSS: The CSS styling is applied to enhance the visual appearance of the clock. It includes custom styles for the clock container, digits, and background, allowing you to personalize the clock's appearance according to your preferences.

    JavaScript: The JavaScript code is responsible for updating the clock display. It retrieves the current time using the Date object, extracts the hours, minutes, and seconds, and dynamically updates the corresponding HTML elements with the new values. The clock updates continuously, reflecting the accurate time.
